# Project Overview

The primary goal of the project is to implement and analyze various sorting algorithms in the C programming language. The participating teams are expected to gain a deep understanding of sorting algorithms, Big O notation, and related concepts.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the project, the participants should be able to:

- Implement at least four different sorting algorithms in C.
- Understand and explain the concept of Big O notation and evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm.
- Select the most appropriate sorting algorithm for a given input.
- Comprehend the concept of stable sorting algorithms.

## Project Structure and Requirements

- The project is completed by John Alex Sagwe.
- The code should adhere to specific requirements, including using allowed editors, compiling on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with specified options, following the Betty style, and avoiding the use of global variables.
- Each sorting algorithm should be implemented in a separate C file, with no more than five functions per file.
- A README.md file is mandatory at the root of the project folder.
