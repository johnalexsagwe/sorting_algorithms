<Project Overview:>
The primary goal of the project is to implement and analyze various sorting algorithms in the C programming language. The participating teams are expected to gain a deep understanding of sorting algorithms, Big O notation, and related concepts.

####Learning Objectives:
By the end of the project, the participants should be able to:

Implement at least four different sorting algorithms in C.
Understand and explain the concept of Big O notation and evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm.
Select the most appropriate sorting algorithm for a given input.
Comprehend the concept of stable sorting algorithms.
Project Structure and Requirements:

The project should be completed in teams of two people (e.g., "John Alex Sagwe").
The code should adhere to specific requirements, including using allowed editors, compiling on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with specified options, following the Betty style, and avoiding the use of global variables.
Each sorting algorithm should be implemented in a separate C file, with no more than five functions per file.
A README.md file is mandatory at the root of the project folder.
The project involves the use of doubly linked lists for sorting and includes provided functions for printing arrays and lists.
Participants are prohibited from using standard library functions unless specified otherwise.
The project includes specific quiz questions and tasks related to the implementation of sorting algorithms.
